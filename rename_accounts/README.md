Effective dates plugin for Beancount
------------------------------------

Plugin to rename accounts. Currently, Expenses:Taxes is hardcoded to be renamed to
Income:Taxes, to avoid Taxes cluttering and dominating the Expense reports (and thus
rendering them less useful).

TODO:
- accept an arbitrary set of account pairs to rename
- accept regexes for renames
